# Madrid-Air-Quality-Project

# Project Overview
Air pollutants have increased received a lot of scrutiny over the years.  For
this analysis, I used the Madrid Air Quality dataset.  There were two sets of
files.  One was for the years 2008-2018 and the other a single file for all
the stations that were used.  For more information about the datasets you
